# ESP - Electronic Structure Package

Rust implementation of the following electronic structure algorithms:
1. Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) - an efficient, deterministic, variational active space solver
2. Semistochastic multireference perturbation theories:
  a. Strongly-Contracted NEVPT2 (WIP)
  b. Epstein-Nesbet (often referred to as Semistochastic HCI (SCHI) when applied to an HCI reference)
